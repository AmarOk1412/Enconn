The day before the [FOSDEM](/dev/fosdem), I visited Brussels. It was a 26 km day walk. In the morning I went to *Atomium* built for the World's Fair Expo (1958). Then I wanted to go to the "Serres Royales", but it was raining so I come back in the center.

In the center I saw the *Palace of Justice* a great building you can see far away. In this area, you have a lot of buildings. For example, you can see [*la Pharmacie anglaise*](http://www.lapharmacieanglaise.com/), the palace of Brussels, etc.

At 3:00 I ate near the *Galeries Saint-Hubert* and I visited the *Grand Place* (UNESCO World Heritage Site) where you can find the guild houses and I finished to visit the area by seeing the *Manneken Pis* and a graffiti of *Tintin*.
