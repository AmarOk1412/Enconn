# FOSDEM?

The [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2018/) (*Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting*) is an event about FOSS (*suprised?*). It was started in 2000 and is held annually, during the first week-end of February at the [ULB](http://www.ulb.ac.be/). For 5 years I tried to go to this event but I couldn't (due to a lot of reasons). So, this was my first FOSDEM experience and I'm not disappointed at all. I arrived in Brussels the Thursday before FOSDEM to visit and did a walk day ([photos](/logs/brussels)).

Note: ULB contains *Libre*, the translation of *Free* in french.

# Highlights

During FOSDEM you can see a lot of people, talks and stands. I didn't see in person a lot of talks because I had to meet a lot of persons, had to give my talks and I preferred to see people I can't see during the rest of the year. But this is some conferences I saw (directly or in the train):

+ [Python 3: 10 years later](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/python3/) to get a history of Python.
+ [GStreamer for tiny devices](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/gstreamer_for_tiny_devices/): to discover some tools to optimize the size of the gstreamer binary (or other binaries) for a camera with not so much space.
+ [Anonymous Whistleblowing with SecureDrop](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/securedroppresentation/): because SecureDrop is a really nice project and if you want to understand how it works with nice schemas.
+ [Speech-to-Text in Jitsi Meet](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/jitsi/): I'm a little bit disappointed by this talk. Because they use the Google Speech API to do that, and I wanted to discover an alternative to current proprietary solutions but in the future they want to use things like Common voice by Mozilla. Still a nice project.
+ [Qt GUIs with Rust](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/rust_qt_binding_generator/) and [GStreamer & Rust](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/rust_gstreamer/) because it still good to see big libraries coming in Rust.
+ [Tizen:RT](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/tizen_rt/) to discover the tizen ecosystem.

Also, I'm currently waiting the videos of these: https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/mozilla_deepspeech_common_voice_projects/ and https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/peertube/ because I want to see these projects alive!

You also can watch a lot of talks in [the decentralized room](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/track/decentralised_internet_and_privacy/) like Contributopia (by [Framasoft](https://framasoft.org/)).

# Other highlights

During FOSDEM, building K contains a lot of booth. It's the better place to discover new projects, talk to someone and not far from the cafeteria. This is some news or some cool projects I discovered in this place.

+ [Godot 3.0 is out!](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-0-released)
+ [VLC 3.0 is near!](https://www.ghacks.net/2018/02/07/vlc-3-0-media-player-release/)
+ [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is now compatible with Python scripts!
+ I now have [gitmate.io](https://gitmate.io/) to try

And lot of nice projects like [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/), [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org), [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/), [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), SecureDrop, Tor, etc.

# My talks

I gave 2 talks with Adrien BÃ©raud at FOSDEM. It was the first time I give a talk in English in front of more than 200 attendants. And... it was awesome! The public is nice, questions are precise and give nice discussions even after the talk.

## Ring as a free universal distributed communication platform.

A conference about the state of Ring in 2018. The video is [here](https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/fosdem/2018/H.1301%20\(Cornil\)/ring.webm) and slides ([pdf](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/ring/attachments/slides/2379/export/events/attachments/ring/slides/2379/slides.pdf)) and sources [here](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/Slides-Ring)

## OpenDHT: make your project distributed

A conference about [OpenDHT](http://opendht.net). I mainly talked about the proxy feature and push notifications support. The video is not available yet, but will be [here](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/opendht/)

# Special thanks

First, thanks to [Savoir-Faire Linux](http://savoirfairelinux.com/) for the opportunity to give a talk @ FOSDEM. And thanks to the FOSDEM team, the organization is just crazy (about 10K people to host, hardware, shirts, video to publish quickly (after 1 day, hundred of videos are available)). I helped to organized some little events and I know how hard it can be, but wow.

Only negative feedback I can give, maybe a lack of diversity? But still, I hope I will be there next year.
