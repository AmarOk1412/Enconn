# What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is an event where you can get a T-shirt if you create 4 Pull Requests on Github between October 1-31. So, it's the perfect occasion to begin to contribute on your favorite projects or to discover new projects. This year, 10,227 developers complete the challenge and 92,569 PR was created.

# What I did?

For this hacktoberfest I contribute to some projects:

+ Mozilla Firefox but it's not on github
+ [Firefox Devtools Bug Finder](http://firefox-dev.tools/?)
+ [Zeste De Savoir](https://zestedesavoir.com/) because I love this site.
+ [TTyRec](/dev/ttyrec) to record your shell
+ [nomades][https://github.com/XavCC/nomades] which is a repository on travelers.

# What's next?

You can find a lot of events to contribute. For example, in December, you have [24PR](https://24pullrequests.com/), during the summer you can make a GSOC, etc. Feel free to contribute, there is a lot of possibilities and it's really fun!
